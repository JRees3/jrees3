    <p>I love Jesus Christ. He is the loathed king of the demons. Soon he shall come back and purge this degenerate spiritually diseased people that scourge this land and wreak havoc among the virtuous <br> and noble. </h2>  <br>

        <p>Rabbits are little creatures with long ears and puffy tails, and they move their nose up and down in an adorable way. They eat the most orange vegetables in <em>our</em> world, and <strong>they reproduce more than any human <em>ever</em> has</strong>.</p>

I don't want to see you <br>
scooping up the field mice <br>
and bopping them on the head!</p>

<p>When I was a little kid,
    a "<em class="big">diminutive juvenile</em>," <br>
    I liked my folks to read to me,
    I was an <em class="big">"eager bibliophile."</em> <br>
    Now I love words for how they sound <br>
    And how they <em class="big">"communicate."</em> <br>
    Perhaps I should explain myself,
    that is, <em class="big">"elucidate."</em> <br>
    Great big words, I like <em class="big">big</em> words. <br>
    Letter by letter, the <em class="bigger">bigger</em> the better <br>
    Great big words. La la la la la la la la la la!</p>
